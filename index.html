                <p>Masks are a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives.

                    Wearing well-fitted masks should be used as part of a comprehensive ‘Do it all!’ approach including
                    maintaining physical distancing, avoiding crowded, closed and close-contact settings, ensuring good
                    ventilation of indoor spaces, cleaning hands regularly, and covering sneezes and coughs with a
                    tissue of bent elbow.
